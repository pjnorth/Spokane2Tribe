11/06/2020: This first histogram is a plot of the log(pop20) compared with the population density. It almost forms a nice bell-curve, but after it begins to fall, towards the middle of the histogram, it maintains its height for a couple units before it begins to fall again.

11/06/2020: This second histogram is much for simple and easy to understand. On the x-axis is the number of night-time lights and the y-axis is the population density of the area with that number of night-time lights. This correlation between the number of night-time lights and population density is based on the data between these two variables from the country Laos in 2020.
