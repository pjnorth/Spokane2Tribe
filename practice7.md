# Lab Three - Part One, Two

10/09/2020: This plot was pretty easy to make! I think I got it within the first couple attempts and then I just played around with the colors so that they matched the Laos national flag. It's really good to see such a complex plot like this start to become so simply (even if most of the credit goes to the data and not my code).

10/13/2020: This plot wasn't too much more difficult than the first, but I was stuck when I was trying to add the title of the county (Vientiane) onto the plot. It turns out I had made a couple errors that, while still allowing me to label the subregions, prevented me from being able to label the county over those. Once I made some changes that made it look more like the original code, it worked after adding an additional "geom_sf_text."
