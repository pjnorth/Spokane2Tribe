# Data Science Reflections Four

10/30/2020: This week I chose travel for my Data Science Reflections, because I am very ready to return home for break! Travel looks a lot differnet with the COVID-19 pandemic as well, so uses of data science within the travel agency felt like the right topic to explore this week.

Travel is a growing industry as it becomes available, and affordable, to more people than ever previous. Additionally, tourism, along with travel, has become a global trend. Data science has brought the travel industry several many opportunities, but it also causes challenges and constant change. With more people traveling, larger data chucks are crucial to the data science algorithms being used in order to improve service. However, data science has already been able to improve travel in several cases.
First, data science has allowed for, “personalized marketing and customer segmentation,” (Bobriakov) which tends to be highly appreciated by travelers. In order to personalize one’s travel experience, companies use users’ “behavioral and metadata, CRM data, geolocation, and social media data,” to conclude the preferences of the user in the future. Before, travel companies would have to make more broad assumptions about consumer preference, but now they can individualize the services needed to satisfy each user specifically. This preference data is likely the most important to the industry as a whole. Recommendation engines are another very closely related data science tool that takes the user’s preference data and match their wishes with the available opportunities. Additionally, as making travel more efficient and user-friendly is clearly the most crucial application of data science, companies go even a step further using, “route optimization,” to minimize cost, time, and distance spent by the customers in order to therefore maximize satisfaction.
Travel has also begun using newer and complex data science tools to improve the efficiency of the industry such as AI and analytics. Companies have been using travel support bots are, “AI-powered bot[s] [that] can answer questions, save user’s time and money, organize the trip and suggest new places to visit.” These bots also use machine learning and become, “smarter and helpful every day,” as they experience an increased number of interactions. Analytics are applicable in many ways to travel, but, “one of the most vivid cases of real-time analytics in travel is tourism analytics,” which can create models to predict activity in specific areas over a set time period. Predictive analytics are also used for forecasting pricing since they are constantly changing. With data science, machine learning can take external factors to predict any movement in price. Overall, data science is all exclusively used to increase customer ease and satisfaction in a travel industry that is growing rapidly.
