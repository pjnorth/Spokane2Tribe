My name is Patrick North and I'm from Spokane, Washington. I am now a freshman at William & Mary and I'm excited to be starting a new chapter in my life! This GitHub depository is for my DATA 100: Wicked Problems classroom. I look forward to exploring Data Science!

I created my first script in RStudio by following the steps given in Professor Frazier's "Getting Started with R & RStudio!" It was very fun to create a line plot in R and I look forward to learning how to create some of my own with differnet data. Some of the steps were a bit difficult to follow at first, but I think I mostly understand the basics now.
