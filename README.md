Hi! My name is Patrick North and I'm from Spokane, Washington. I am a freshman at the College of William & Mary and I'm excited to start this new chapter in my life! I'm interested in statistics/data science/business analytics and I'll be running Cross Country and Track & Field for the Tribe. This GitHub depository is for my DATA 100: Wicked Problems classroom. I look forward to exploring Data Science!
