# Data Science Reflections Two

09/22/2020: My second data science reflections is on data science's application to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While data science and technology do not represent a reliable, long-term solution to the threat this virus poses, both have the power to make accurate predictions about the virus' affect that will allow the U.S. healthcare system to endure without being overwhelmed.

Data science is already used across the healthcare field to provide constant, reliable estimations regarding the demands for the specific health services. However, this information proves especially useful now when such data collection plans are required for most reopening plans and the data could be used to make the best public health recommendations. The article focuses specifically on a, "dynamic feedback loop," that would track healthcare  avaliable in each region and make predictions regarding the risk of a demand due to COVID-19 that would overloading hospitals and other healthcare outlets.

However, it is difficult for the feedback loop to provide useful data regarding health system resource needs for several reasons. First, most public health departments report data with delays and error. This makes the numbers significantly less useful. ALso, most hospital activity reflects virus activity from several days prior since it takes signigicant time for symptoms to appear. Therefore, data scientists must use, "proxy measures," such as positive test rates, COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 deaths. With these benchmarks, "infection prevalence" can determine if the current policies are effective.

Finally, this "dynamic feedback loop" is closed by tracking via smartphone. This gives the feedback loop the, "ability to project from mobility to transmission to health system burden," and the desired outcome that predicts the health system resources for the next two weeks. Additionally, other research has been produced to calculate an attempted "tolerable transmisison" value: a number representing the maximum infections in a given region that would not exceed health system capacity. By monitoring transmission, data can alert those in a position of power to make changes that would reduce mobility of the population.

The ultimate goal of this data science is to take last week's population mobility, along with today's transmission rate, and produce hospital demand two weeks in the future. However, a trade-off of the project is privacy. Despite this, an "early warning system" that would predict when a increase in COIVD-19 restrictions is urgent given the current impacts.
