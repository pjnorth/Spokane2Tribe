09/22/2020: My second data science reflecitons is on data science's application to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While data science and technology do not represent a reliable, long-term solution to the threat this virus poses, they have the power to make accurate predictions about the virus' affect that will allow the U.S. healthcare system to endure without being overwhelmed.

Data science is already used across the healthcare field to provide constant, reliable estimations regarding the demands for the specific health services. However, this information proves especially useful now when such data collection plans are required for most reopening plans and the data could be used to make the best public health recommendations. The article focuses specifically on a, "dynamic feedback loop," that would track healthcare  avaliable in each region and make predictions regarding the risk of a demand due to COVID-19 that would overloading hospitals and other healthcare outlets.
