# Data Science Reflections Three

This week I chose to do my Data Science Reflections around another current event, and I decided to analyze an article on how data science is used around an election. I found a few articles on the topic and decided to go with one titled, "How Data Can Win You An Election." The article focuses on targeted advertising, which the author describes as a, “precision guided missile,” (Mills) and how to make an effective system that will influence targeted individuals. Data science has been used in the past for political advertising, most prominently by Cambridge Analytica back in 2018 when the data analytics company, “was revealed to have acquired the data of 50 million Facebook users.” A former employee of the company described their political ad targeting as, “weapon-grade,” which embodies the power a data science system can have with machine learning.

Targeted advertising is all about nudges, which the author defines as, “small changes in how decisions are framed which can have large and predictable effects on outcomes,” and is a term that stems from behavioral analytics. However, these nudges are only useful in targeting individuals when they are personalized. Behavioral scientists use, “the combination of big data and behavioral insights,” to create highly effective ad targeting. Additionally, the behavioral scientists need to adjust their targeting based on a few behavioral traits. The article mentions impatience and risk aversion as two important traits that will determine the effectiveness of varying ads to their assigned individual. One point in the article that stood out to me was when the author said, “The goal isn’t to find the most effective advertisement; it’s to map effectiveness onto behavioral traits,” because most people would think the most effective article would accomplish the most for these firms that want to influence individuals. However, that is not the case because an effective advertisement is only the most effective for a small quantity of people. These behavioral scientists would rather be able to map effectiveness of ads to those with specific traits in order to create several “most efficient” advertisements that will maximize influence for each individual since the ads are tailored to their behavioral traits.

Lastly, once the behavioral scientists can discover, “patterns between those behavioral traits and individual behavior on social media,” they can apply specific targeted advertisements to those who are impatient, low risk, etc. From there, all that needs to be done is frequent updating of the database to continually improve the accuracy of an individual’s online inferences. This will make, “the nudges more effective, and the data more powerful,” until the influence reaches its peak. With all the data and behavioral scientists there are, a large industry in targeting advertising could begin to appear. However, similar to the analogy used in the beginning of the article, “hypernudging can be weaponized,” and it’s typically not used in the interest of users.
