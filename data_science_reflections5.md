# Data Science Knowledge Creation

  The introduction of data science into today’s society has had an impact that is both thus far not completely understood and has yet to meet its full potential. Data science is a relatively new field, but it has already shown the transformative power it has to convert bodies of data into meaningful interpretations and predications. There are several barriers that exist in the way of maximizing the potential impact of data science, notably time and privacy, but the impressive future of data science will not remain unrealized for long as the topic continues to gain traction in a world defined by technological advances. The ability to convert data into meaningful models or functions allows data scientists to make accurate predictions about human behavior that can then be used to ultimately influence one’s behavior.
  
  Most recently, I have been using data science to analyze and model boundaries and human settlements within my country of choice, Laos. As explained by Sinan Aral that, “Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement,” (Aral) it is clear that the birth of data science is a direct result of the revolutionary technological advances worldwide that allow for greater data collection. As the ability to measure new data increases around the world, data scientists can begin to model these developing countries that were previously more remote with less known about them. For instance, a census is the way countries have begun tracked their population data in order to describe and analyze their population. A revolution in measurement is blooming and a revolution in science is surely to follow as data science makes further advancements.
  
  Though data science poses as a tool that could lead our world into a new era of technology with the ability to convert unfathomable amounts of data into unlimited influence and effective decision-making, privacy is a major issue that stands in the way of reaching that reality. Though there are vastly more connections we have the potential to observe and record, most of the data required to uncover these unseen relationships, typically smartphone data, remains secure to provide privacy protection to users. However, while cellphone data would likely be used for economic gain, Owen Barder notes that, “And his (Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen) insight, which is, really, at the heart of all this stuff, is that economic systems are not like evolutionary systems, they are evolutionary systems,” (Barder). Therefore, although data science could be used to influence economic decisions of consumers, it is a small tradeoff compared to the larger evolutionary gain of data science applications.
  
  I think the application of data science into everyday life would have no limit on its ability to improve the human condition, at least not one I believe we would ever reach. Data science feels like a pandora’s box, a source of great power and trouble, while also appearing as a multitool that data scientists are constantly finding a new use for. In the words of Geoff West, “Data provide the basis of constructing, testing, and refining our theories and models whether they seek to explain the origins of the universe, the nature of evolutionary processes, or the growth of the economy,” (West). Data science has no boundaries once the data is accessible, but a lack of data accessibility can pose barrier. There will certainly be controversy whether or not certain data of individuals should be accessible. However, I think it is in the best interest of our society to safely invest in data science to maximize the benefits it offers.
